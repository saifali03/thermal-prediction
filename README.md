# CPU Thermal-Prediction

Apple Silicon thermal distress prediction project for session-based telemetry collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and upcoming classification experiments.

This repository is currently a **working team repo**. It is public, but the main goal right now is to let teammates pull the code, understand the pipeline, reproduce the setup, inspect the raw/interim data, and continue into imbalance handling and model training.

## Project goal

The project aims to predict **imminent thermal distress** on an Apple Silicon machine from time-series telemetry collected during different workload sessions. The current pipeline collects telemetry on macOS, stores it in structured raw-session files, cleans and merges sessions, handles gaps and missingness, constructs a forward-looking binary target, performs exploratory analysis, and engineers temporal features for machine learning.

In practical terms, the workflow is:

1.  Collect telemetry on an Apple Silicon Mac.
2.  Store each logging run as a session CSV plus session metadata.
3.  Merge sessions into one analysis table.
4.  Clean timing issues, gaps, and missing values.
5.  Create labels using a look-ahead prediction horizon.
6.  Explore the data and verify class balance.
7.  Engineer lag, rolling, and change-based features.
8.  Move next into imbalance handling and model training.

## Current status

Implemented now:

- Apple Silicon telemetry logger with structured raw-data output.
- Session registry for tracking runs and metadata.
- Stress runner for creating controlled workload sessions.
- Modular preprocessing pipeline split into separate Python files.
- Jupyter notebook for end-to-end experimentation and EDA.
- Binary label construction using a forward prediction horizon.
- Feature engineering with lags, rolling statistics, deltas, accelerations, and proxy features.

Planned next:

- Class imbalance handling, including class weights and possibly SMOTE or related resampling.
- Model training and comparison using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and a Neural Network.
- Proper evaluation with precision, recall, F1, PR curves, ROC curves, and threshold tuning.
- Feature selection, calibration, and model packaging.

### What each part does

#### `code/m_series_telemetry_logger_v3_sessionized.py`

Runs the macOS telemetry logger for Apple Silicon. It records structured samples at a chosen interval, writes each run to a raw session CSV, and updates a session registry.

#### `code/intermittent_stress_runner.py`

Creates intermittent stress/load patterns to generate more useful thermal behaviour in the dataset.

#### `code/data_loader.py`

Loads session files and merges them into one dataframe for downstream analysis.

#### `code/data_quality.py`

Handles time-order checks, trimming, and temporal gap management.

#### `code/data_transform.py`

Handles missing-value treatment, transformations, and target-distribution checks.

#### `code/data_labels.py`

Constructs the prediction target using a look-ahead window / prediction horizon.

#### `code/data_eda.py`

Contains exploratory plots, descriptive statistics, and signal/relationship inspection helpers.

#### `code/data_features.py`

Creates machine-learning features such as lags, rolling summaries, differences, accelerations, and engineered proxies.

#### `code/data_prep.py`

Holds reusable preparation logic and pipeline helpers used to keep the notebook cleaner.

#### `notebooks/playground.ipynb`

Main working notebook for running the end-to-end pipeline, validating outputs, and experimenting interactively.

#### `data/raw/`

Contains raw per-session CSV files produced by the logger.

#### `data/interim/`

Contains intermediate outputs such as the session registry and any cleaned or derived tabular files you choose to save.

#### `artifacts/`

Intended for saved models, scalers, encoders, plots, and other generated outputs.

## Data layout and naming

The telemetry logger is designed to save one CSV per session under a structured folder tree.

Expected pattern:

``` text
data/raw/<machine_id>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<machineid><yyyymmdd><run_number>.csv
```

There is also a session registry file, typically in:

``` text
data/interim/sessionregistry.csv
```

A typical session ID looks like:

``` text
macm520260627001
```

This convention makes it easier to track which machine produced which run, on which date, and in what order.

## Environment setup

## 1) Clone the repo

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/saifali03/thermal-prediction.git
cd thermal-prediction

## macOS telemetry collection

This section is the most important for teammates who want to collect new Apple Silicon telemetry.

### Requirements

- An Apple Silicon Mac.
- Python 3.11 or similar.
- Permission to run commands with `sudo`.
- `powermetrics` available on macOS.
- Python packages from `requirements.txt`.

### Why `sudo` is needed

The logger relies on macOS `powermetrics` for core telemetry. On Apple Silicon, detailed power and thermal information is typically only available through privileged access, so the logger should be run with `sudo`.

### Example logging command

Run from the repository root:

``` bash
sudo python3 code/m_series_telemetry_logger_v3_sessionized.py \
  --interval 5 \
  --machine-id macm5 \
  --base-dir data/raw \
  --registry-path data/interim/sessionregistry.csv \
  --notes "baseline or workload description here"
```

### What the command does

- `--interval 5` logs a sample every 5 seconds.
- `--machine-id macm5` tags the session with the machine identity.
- `--base-dir data/raw` stores raw sessions inside the repo data folder.
- `--registry-path data/interim/sessionregistry.csv` updates the shared registry.
- `--notes` records useful session context for later analysis.

### Suggested collection procedure

To make the dataset useful, collect **different workload regimes**, not only one kind of session.

Recommended session types:

- Idle / near-idle.
- Light browsing and office work.
- Video playback.
- Coding / notebook execution.
- Sustained CPU-heavy work.
- Intermittent stress sessions.
- Real mixed-use sessions.

For each run, write a short note describing:

- what was running,
- whether charger was connected,
- room conditions if relevant,
- whether background apps were open,
- whether it was a deliberately stressed run.

## Stress generation

To intentionally create more varied thermal patterns, use the stress runner.

Example:

``` bash
python3 code/intermittent_stress_runner.py
```

If your script accepts arguments, adapt as needed after checking the file help/options.

Recommended workflow:

1.  Start the logger.
2.  Start the intermittent stress runner.
3.  Let the machine cycle through work and rest periods.
4.  Stop both and confirm the session file and registry entry were created.

## Running the analysis pipeline

The notebook is currently the easiest entry point for the full workflow.

### Pipeline order

The analysis flow is roughly:

1.  Load and merge all session CSVs.
2.  Trim edge rows and handle temporal gaps.
3.  Handle missing values.
4.  Construct labels using a thermal threshold and a look-ahead horizon.
5.  Verify target distribution.
6.  Run EDA.
7.  Engineer features.
8.  Drop invalid boundary rows created by lag/rolling features.
9.  Proceed to modelling.

### Typical notebook logic

A representative sequence is:

``` python
from data_loader import *
from data_quality import *
from data_transform import *
from data_labels import *
from data_eda import *
from data_features import *
from data_prep import *

DATADIR = "data/raw"

rawdf = load_and_merge_sessions(DATADIR)
dfnogaps = trim_and_handle_gaps(rawdf)
dfimputed = handle_missing_values(dfnogaps)
dffinal = construct_labels(dfimputed, temp_threshold_c=75.0)
dffeatures = engineer_features(dffinal)
dfmlready = drop_invalid_rows(dffeatures)
```

Note: function names may vary slightly depending on your latest local edits. Keep the README aligned with the current module API when pushing updates.

## Label definition

The current target is a **forward-looking binary label**.

In simple terms:

- a thermal event is identified when the monitored target crosses the defined threshold,
- the rows within a fixed look-ahead horizon before that event are labelled positive,
- the rest are labelled negative.

This means the model is not learning to detect that the machine is already hot; it is learning to predict that a hot/distress state is coming soon.

Current working setup in the notebook appears to use:

- temperature threshold around `75.0 C`,
- prediction horizon of `1.0 minute`,
- 5-second sampling, which implies 12 future steps for the horizon.

Adjust these values carefully, because they directly change the class balance and the meaning of the target.

## Current dataset snapshot

From the latest notebook state, the merged data appears to include multiple sessions and thousands of rows. A recent run in the notebook shows 5 merged sessions and 4,725 labelled rows after trimming and look-ahead handling, with class distribution approximately 83.05% class 0 and 16.95% class 1.

That level of imbalance is moderate rather than extreme, which is why the next sensible phase is to compare weighting and resampling strategies before training the final classifiers.

## Features engineered so far

The current feature engineering appears to include:

- lags for temperature, power, activity, and frequency signals,
- rolling mean/std/max/min/range over windows such as 30s, 1m, 5m, and some longer summaries,
- first differences and multi-step differences,
- acceleration-style features,
- proxy features such as thermal distress indicators and pressure/power interaction features.

These are exactly the kinds of temporal summary features needed before trying baseline classifiers.

## Next phase roadmap

### 1) Class imbalance handling

To test next:

- no balancing baseline,
- class weights,
- random over/under-sampling,
- SMOTE or related synthetic oversampling methods,
- threshold moving after probability prediction.

Because this is time-series-derived tabular data, be careful with leakage. Any balancing must be applied **inside the training fold only**, never before the train/validation split.

### 2) Model training

Planned models:

- Logistic Regression,
- Random Forest,
- Gradient Boosting,
- Neural Network.

### 3) Evaluation

Recommended metrics:

- Precision,
- Recall,
- F1-score,
- PR-AUC,
- ROC-AUC,
- confusion matrix,
- lead-time usefulness for positives.

Because the task is early-warning prediction, recall and precision around the positive class usually matter more than raw accuracy.

## Practical Implementation

A planned practical extension of this project is a **live predictive monitoring mode** in which the telemetry logger and trained prediction pipeline run locally on the user’s machine in near real time. In that setup, incoming telemetry samples would be processed continuously, transformed into the same feature space used during training, and passed through the fitted model so the system can estimate whether the machine is entering a rising thermal-risk state before critical heat levels are reached.

If the model detects elevated near-future thermal risk, the local application can issue a simple warning through the terminal or a lightweight on-screen alert box. The purpose of the warning is not to alarm the user, but to encourage practical action such as reducing unnecessary workload, reorganising tabs, closing heavy background processes, or spreading tasks more efficiently so that sustained thermal stress is reduced and long-term device strain may be limited.

## Important cautions

### Data leakage

Avoid leakage from the future into the past.

- Split by session where appropriate.
- Do not fit imputers/scalers on the full dataset before splitting.
- Do not oversample before splitting.
- Keep future-derived columns out of features.

### Local paths

Some current scripts/notebook cells may still contain absolute local paths. Before pushing, replace them with repository-relative paths such as `data/raw` and `data/interim/sessionregistry.csv`.
